# Snake
This project resembles the classic Snake game.
It took me 46 hours to create and I added commits for each new functionality implemented. 
The most difficult functionality to implement was the snake movement. I implemented it by constantly removing the snake tail and updating the head on the new position according to the direction given by the keyboard input.
In the following video I explained how I created the project:
